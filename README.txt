This repository contains configuration files and scripts to support the functionality described in
my talk, "Dynamic Indexing: A Tragic Solr Story," given at the code4lib conference in Portland,
Oregon in February, 2015. I apologize for the haphazard nature of what you see - if you're
really interested, I'd be happy to explain what I can - feel free to contact me.
